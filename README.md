# Sign-In-Page
A modern and minimalist sign-in interface that prioritizes user experience through clean design. This authentication page features both social media integration (Google, Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn) and traditional email/password login functionality. The interface sports a professional purple accent theme with a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the project implements OAuth 2.0 for social authentication while maintaining accessibility standards. The sign-in page includes intuitive features like password recovery and quick access to registration for new users. Its straightforward implementation and clean code structure make it an ideal starting point for web applications requiring user authentication or as a learning resource for developers studying modern authentication flows.
